# WomenInHeadlines

This project was completed as part of Data 311 at Western Washington University
Project collaborators: Takira Boltman, Katie Campbell, and Maddie Knappenberger

Description:
This project analyzes bias in news headlines from a handful of major countries - all centered around women. To do this we used machine learning tools and data science techniques. We aimed to look at potential bias against women. 

Cleaning Headlines:
First, we took large amounts of data, cleaned it, and preprocessed it. We had to handle missing data, remove duplicates, and ensure the text was standardized. 

Topic Modeling: 
This was done using Python, BERTopic, and the Vader sentiment analysis tool. 

Relationship Exploration: 
For this, we used data visualization techniques to view our findings and present them.
